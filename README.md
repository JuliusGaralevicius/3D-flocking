# 3D-flocking
3D flocking with spatial subdivision   
Up/down and Left/right arrows to control homing and avoidance behaviour.   
Use 1/2/3 on the number row of keyboard to toggle Boid simulation, Obstacles and debug shape.   

Tested with 960m gtx, Visual Studio 2017 x86 debug mode.   
The attached image shows execution flow of Boid simulation and maps well to Boid class code.
